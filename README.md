**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Michael Fang**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/codepath---site-prework)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

    I ran into an issue with the the buttons leading to a NULL. Used Stack Overflow to find out why it was happening, and after some digging around in the code, I found out the issue. Didn't know what was wrong with my code so I decided to copy the code from the guide and it worked out.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

    There wasn't any major issue with the actual coding part, but there was some difficulty with the logic with the guess function. I referenced the guess function to  create my own function, but that lead to the issue listed above (in question 1). Decided to copy the code from the walkthrough guide to make sure everything was    working. Recording the Gifs wasn't as fun since I had to do multiple gifs to demonstrate all the required functionalities. Also since I can't mess up the pattern during the last part of the demo with the actual game. Using Github and Glitch wasn't a major issue for me, but I never used Glitch before this prework assignment. I have some bsaic experience with Git so there wasn't any issues creating the repository. Mainly exporting the project from Glitch to the repo was something new. Another challenge was having to complete the prework relatively fast as I submitted my application much later. I was hesitating whether or not to apply to the SITES program since I was already planning to take the interview prep course offered by CodePath. If I had started the application earlier I would've been able to try my hand at some of the optional features or come up with my own to create something more interesting than the base game.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    I have had some experience with developing a website in my intro to programming class and during a hackathon, but I never really buckled down and started to learn web development. A question about web development is if it's too late to start trying web development as a freelance job or something similar since I see a lot of people already freelancing to create websites. Is it something I should dive into if I want to improve as a web developer? Will we be focusing on frontend more or backend or both equally? There are full-stack developers, but I'm guessing it'd be best to just focus on one aspect in web development?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    If I had more time on this project, I would add more functions like a second pattern that the user can play with or maybe a login/signup function. Spending more time to pick better colors for the background and buttons. Maybe adding pictures to the buttons might seem interesting as it helps with memorizing the pattern better if there was like a picture of different breeds of dogs or cats. Having different levels of difficulties can also be something I can add. Like show level 1 difficulty. And if the user passes level 1 they move to level 2. Level 2 can have different pitches or more faster paced clues. Adding more buttons in the form of new shapes or different button dimesions to increase the complexity of the game.
